**Note**: There are no bookings on record within this dataset until July 2015.

- Overall booking demand for the City Hotel is **significantly higher** than the Resort Hotel.
- Peak tourist season for both City and Resort Hotels occur during the **Spring, Summer, and Fall**. 
- The average daily rate rises during the **Summer** and falls during the **Winter**.

- **City Hotel**: There is a positive correlation between pricing and demand. As the average daily rate increases during the summer, the trajectory of demand remains unaffected. This indicates that the current pricing strategy for City Hotel is effectively meeting demand during peak tourist seasons.
- **Resort Hotel**: Thereâ€™s a negative correlation between pricing and demand. When ADR increases during the summer, demand decreases, indicating that the current pricing strategy negatively impacts demand.

**Recommendations**: Reassess pricing strategy for the Resort Hotel. 

- Consider lowering the daily rate during the summer. 

- Offer and market summer promotions, discounts, or packages that include additional services like dining, spa treatments, or local tours to attract guests.

- Guests for the City Hotel tend to stay **1 to 3 nights** per booking.

- Guests for the Resort Hotel tend to stay **1 to 3 nights** as well but many are also staying for **7 nights**.

- **Recommendations**: Given the unique demand for 7-night stays, consider creating summer promotions, discounts, and packages specifically tailored for these extended stays. This strategy would not only attract guests looking for longer vacations but also help differentiate the resort hotel from competitors, ultimately driving demand and boosting occupancy.
